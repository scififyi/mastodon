#  (REQUIRED) The location of the pack files.
pack:

    filename: packs/common.js
    stylesheet: true

  settings:

#  (OPTIONAL) The directory which contains localization files for
#  the flavour, relative to this directory. The contents of this
#  directory must be `.js` or `.json` files whose names correspond to
#  language tags and whose default exports are a messages object.
locales: locales

#  (OPTIONAL) A file to use as the preview screenshot for the flavour,
#  or an array thereof. These filenames must be unique across all
#  images (regardless of path), so it's a good idea to namespace them
#  to your theme. It's up to you to let webpack know to compile them.

#  (OPTIONAL) The directory which contains the pack files.
#  Defaults to the theme directory (`app/javascript/themes/[theme]`),
#  which should be sufficient for like 99% of use-cases lol.

#      pack_directory: app/javascript/packs

#  (OPTIONAL) By default the theme will fallback to the default theme
#  if a particular pack is not provided. You can specify different
#  fallbacks here, or disable fallback behaviours altogether by
#  specifying a `null` value.
fallback: glitch
