#  (REQUIRED) The location of the pack file inside `pack_directory`.
pack: index.js

#  (OPTIONAL) The directory which contains the pack file.
#  Defaults to the theme directory (`app/javascript/themes/[theme]`),
#  but in the case of the vanilla Mastodon theme the pack file is
#  somewhere else.
#    pack_directory: app/javascript/packs

#  (OPTIONAL) Additional javascript resources to preload, for use with
#  lazy-loaded components. It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you
#  derive these pathnames from `themes/[your-theme]` to ensure that
#  they stay unique. (Of course, vanilla doesn't do this ^^;;)
# preload:
# - themes/light-glitch/async/getting_started
# - themes/light/glitch/async/compose
# - themes/light/glitch/async/home_timeline
# - themes/light/glitch/async/notifications
